This project implements a sarcasm detection model using machine learning techniques. It processes text data and predicts whether the given sentence is sarcastic or not. The application provides a web interface where users can enter text and receive predictions along with detailed explanations for the classification.

Features:

Sarcasm Classification: The model predicts if a sentence is sarcastic or not.

Explanations: Provides a detailed explanation for why a sentence is classified as sarcastic or not.

Speech Input: Users can input sentences through speech using voice-to-text.

History: View previous predictions.

Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes.

Clear History: Option to remove past predictions.

Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7+
Libraries:
fastapi
uvicorn
scikit-learn
nltk
pandas
pickle

You can install all dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸš€ Setup & Usage

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sarcasm-detection.git
cd sarcasm-detection

2. Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Dataset
The dataset is expected to be in the Data/fixed_file.json file. You can get the dataset from Kaggle or another source.

4. Train the Model:
run : python src/train.py

Once the data is processed, the model is trained using the TF-IDF vectorizer and a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest). The model and vectorizer are saved as .pkl files:

sarcasm_model.pkl
vectorizer.pkl

5. Preprocess Data
The clean_text() function cleans the text data by:
Lowercasing the text
Removing special characters and URLs
Removing stopwords

6. Run the Flask App:
To run the server and start , use the following command:
python app.py

The server will start on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
